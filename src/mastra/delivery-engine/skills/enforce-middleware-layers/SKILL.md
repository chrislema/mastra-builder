description: Evaluates and enforces layered middleware architecture for authentication, authorization, and usage enforcement on API routes. Use when building request middleware, enforcing plans or feature access, or attaching request context to downstream handlers.

Primary roles: engineer

## Purpose

Inspects middleware layers for correct separation of concerns — authentication, authorization, and usage enforcement — and ensures business handlers remain thin by verifying that entitlement checks, denial responses, and context propagation happen at the right layer.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the middleware stack.** Locate root middleware and API middleware entry points. Confirm layering exists (root handles auth, API layer handles authorization and usage).

2. **Verify root middleware responsibilities.** Check that it:
   - Looks for session cookie or Authorization header
   - Verifies the session with the auth system
   - Attaches user, company, and plan data to request context
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Allows public paths (landing, login, signup, static assets) to pass through

3. **Verify API middleware responsibilities.** Check that it:
   - Confirms user exists from root middleware (does not re-authenticate)
   - Checks subscription status (active, past_due, canceled)
   - Calculates current usage from the database
   - Enforces plan limits (prevents requests when limit exceeded)
   - Checks feature access based on plan
   - Attaches usage stats and limits to context

4. **Inspect the context shape.** Confirm `context.data` is populated with the expected structure and that downstream handlers consume it without making additional auth or entitlement checks.

5. **Evaluate denial behavior.** For each denial scenario, verify the response is fast-failing with actionable content:
   - Inactive subscription: 403 with status and renewal URL
   - Usage limit exceeded: 429 with current usage, limit, reset date, and upgrade URL
   - Feature not on plan: 403 with plan name and upgrade path

6. **Check for duplication and leakage.** Flag any business logic that has leaked into middleware, and any entitlement or auth checks duplicated between middleware and handlers.

7. **Produce findings.** Document layer assignments, context shape correctness, denial behavior gaps, and any duplication or leakage issues.

## Reference

### Layered Architecture

Middleware should be layered with clear responsibilities at each level:

**Root middleware** (`functions/_middleware.js`):
- Check for session cookie or Authorization header
- Verify session with auth system
- Attach user/company/plan data to request context
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Allow public paths (landing, login, signup, static assets)

**API middleware** (`functions/api/_middleware.js`):
- Verify authentication (user must exist from root middleware)
- Check subscription status (active, past_due, canceled)
- Calculate current usage from database
- Enforce plan limits (prevent requests if limit exceeded)
- Check feature access based on plan
- Attach usage stats and limits to context

**Why layered:**
- Separation of concerns: auth vs authorization vs usage
- Performance: only check usage for API calls, not page views
- Each layer has single responsibility
- Can add/remove layers without affecting others

### Context Shape

Middleware populates `context.data` for downstream handlers:

```
context.data = {
  user: { id, email, role, ... },
  company: { id, name, subscriptionStatus, ... },
  plan: { name, maxUsers, features, ... },
  usage: { current, limit, remaining },
  sessionToken: "..."
}
```

This data flows to all downstream functions without additional auth checks.

### Denial Patterns

Fail fast with actionable responses:
- Inactive subscription: 403 with status and renewal URL
- Usage limit exceeded: 429 with current usage, limit, reset date, and upgrade URL
- Feature not available on plan: 403 with plan name and upgrade path

### Anti-Patterns

- **Auth checks in handlers**: If a handler re-verifies the session or re-checks plan status, the middleware layer is incomplete or untrusted.
- **Business logic in middleware**: Middleware should not make domain decisions (e.g., choosing quality tiers, formatting responses). It enforces access; handlers do the work.
- **Incomplete context**: If handlers need to query the database for user, company, or plan data that middleware should have attached, the context shape is missing fields.
- **Silent denials**: Returning bare 403/429 without actionable information (renewal URL, upgrade path, usage stats) degrades user experience.

## Output

Produce a review report containing:

1. **Layer map**: Which middleware files exist and what each one is responsible for.
2. **Context shape audit**: The actual `context.data` structure vs. the expected shape, with any missing fields called out.
3. **Denial behavior checklist**: For each denial scenario (inactive subscription, usage exceeded, feature unavailable), whether the response includes the required actionable content.
4. **Duplication findings**: Any auth or entitlement checks found in handlers that belong in middleware.
5. **Leakage findings**: Any business logic found in middleware that belongs in handlers.
